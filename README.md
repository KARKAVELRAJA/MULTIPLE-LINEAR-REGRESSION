# MULTIPLE-LINEAR-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT SALES

- Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent variable and more than one independent variable
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and the output is predicted
- Finally, the predicted output is verified
